# Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data through various visualizations using Python's matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and SQL databases. The goal is to provide insights into different aspects of sales data, such as total revenue, product performance, payment methods, and customer feedback, among others. Each visualization aims to offer a deeper understanding of trends and distributions within the data.
##  Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that the following requirements are met:

### Python
The project is built in Python, so you need Python installed on your machine.
You can download and install Python from python.org.
### Database Setup
You need to have access to an SQL database (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) containing the sales data.
If you're using SQLite, you can directly use the .db file. For MySQL or PostgreSQL, make sure your database server is up and running, and you have access credentials (username, password, host, etc.).
You should have a table (e.g., sales_data) that includes relevant columns like:

Product
Category
Region
Revenue
Quantity Sold
Discount (%)
Order Status
Payment Method
Customer Feedback
Date (optional, for trend analysis)
### Python Libraries
The following Python libraries are required for data manipulation and visualization:

matplotlib: for generating plots.
seaborn: for enhanced visualizations.
pandas: for data manipulation.
numpy: for numerical operations.
mysql-connector-python: to connect to MySQL databases (if you're using MySQL).
## Installation

### Install Python
If you don't have Python installed already, download and install Python from python.org.

After installation, verify that Python is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```
You should see the version of Python you installed.

### Set Up a Database
You need an SQL database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) containing the sales data.
